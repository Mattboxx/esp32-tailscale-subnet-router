> **Status — early access (`v0.1.9`).** Runs daily on the reference
> ESP32-S3 hardware and the core paths (WiFi NAT, Tailscale subnet

## What it is

This firmware turns one ESP32-S3 board into two things at once:

1. **A WiFi NAT router.** It joins your existing 2.4 GHz network as a
   client (STA) and re-broadcasts its own access point (AP). The IoT
   devices on that AP reach the internet through the upstream WiFi, with
   NAPT, DHCP, and an on-board DNS forwarder.
2. **A Tailscale subnet router.** It runs a userspace WireGuard +
   Tailscale (`ts2021`) stack, so any peer on your tailnet can reach the
   devices behind its AP — and the AP-side devices can use the ESP as a
   Tailscale **exit node** gateway. No client software on the IoT
   devices, no cloud account on the LAN.

Everything — WiFi credentials, the tailnet auth key, advertised routes,
firewall rules, diagnostics — is configured from a phone or laptop
browser. There is no app and no serial console required after the first
flash.

<br><em>The Status dashboard: uplink, access point, Tailscale node and peers at a glance.</em>
</div>

## Why

Most "put a sensor on Tailscale" setups need either a Raspberry Pi
acting as a subnet router or per-device Tailscale clients. This project
collapses that into a ~$10 board you can leave plugged into a USB
charger: it bridges a whole IoT subnet onto your tailnet *and* gives
those devices internet through an exit node, while staying small enough
to ignore.

## Where it fits

Typical setups people use it for:

- **Weekend house / cabin.** A Tasmota/Shelly AC, water heater or
  freeze-guard on the cabin's existing WiFi — your home Home Assistant
  sees and controls it, with no public IP, port-forward or VPN server on
  the cabin's router.
- **Parents' / grandparents' place.** A couple of sensors (temperature,
  door/window, water-leak) pulled into your own HA so you can watch them
  and get alerted, without ever touching their router.
- **CGNAT / mobile-broadband locations.** Sites with no public IP (4G
  routers, shared building internet) that you could never reach before —
  the tailnet bridges the CGNAT, so HA sees everything anyway.
- **Garage / workshop / shed.** There's WiFi, but you don't want to set up
  a VLAN or VPN; the garage door, irrigation or a frost guard just show
  up in HA.
- **Rentals / networks you don't own.** Not your router, no right to
  port-forward — the ESP puts your gadgets on the tailnet as a node, done.

The common thread: there's WiFi on site, but you can't (or don't want to)
touch the router. That's exactly where this fits.

## What it's for — and what it isn't

This is a **micro-controller** doing userspace encryption and NAT on a
single shared 2.4 GHz radio. Its job is **reach, not throughput** — size
your expectations accordingly.

**✅ What it's for**

- IoT / home-automation gear: **sensors, smart switches, plugs,
  thermostats**, energy/environmental monitors, ESPHome / Zigbee / MQTT
  bridges — anything small and low-bandwidth.
- Low-rate control and status traffic: bursty, tiny payloads that are perfectly
  happy with around a megabit.
- Reaching a device stuck behind NAT/CGNAT so you (or Home Assistant) can
  poll it, flip a relay, or SSH in from anywhere on your tailnet.

**🚫 What it's not for**

- Being the everyday internet uplink for your **phone or laptop**.
- **Streaming, video calls, or watching a camera feed in high resolution.**
- Large downloads, backups, OTA images for other devices — anything
  bandwidth-heavy.
- A general-purpose VPN gateway for fast clients.

Real-world throughput through the tunnel runs **roughly 0.3–1.4 Mbit/s**,
depending on the path — plain STA routing is at the top of that range, a
**direct** exit node in the middle, and a **DERP-relayed** exit node at
the bottom. Plenty for switches and sensors, not for media. If you need
real bandwidth, put a Raspberry Pi (or similar) on that job instead. *(Configuring the device from a
phone or laptop browser is of course fine — that's just the admin UI, not
traffic you route through it.)*

## Features

- **Dual role** — simultaneous WiFi STA (uplink) + AP (NAT router) +
  Tailscale subnet router.
- **Expose the upstream LAN too** — beyond its own AP subnet, an optional
  Source-NAT (à la Tailscale `--snat-subnet-routes`) lets tailnet peers reach
  the network the device is *connected to*, with no static route needed on the
  upstream router.
- **Web UI for everything** — optional password gate and session timeout, WiFi join,
  tailnet enrolment, routes, firewall, diagnostics. Dark, responsive,
  single-page; served straight off the device.
- **Tailscale, the real protocol** — DISCO peer discovery, direct paths
  *and* DERP relay fallback, NAT traversal, MagicDNS-aware, exit-node
  client and gateway. Powered by [microlink](https://github.com/Csontikka/microlink).
- **Exit-node aware routing** — AP clients' internet traffic can be
  forced through a chosen Tailscale exit node; when the exit node is
  unreachable the firmware **fails closed** (traffic stops) rather than
  silently leaking to the local uplink.
- **Stateful-ish ACL firewall** — four hook points (Internet↔ESP,
  Clients↔ESP) with first-match-wins rules by protocol / CIDR / port /
  action, plus per-rule hit counters.
- **DNS forwarder with cache** — on-board resolver for AP clients with a
  PSRAM-backed response cache and configurable upstream.
- **Operations toolbox** — on-device ping / traceroute / route-explain,
  live WiFi scan, and a microSD "flight recorder" for catching
  control-plane stalls.
- **DHCP niceties** — reservations, live lease table, per-client signal,
  and a MAC denylist.
- **Selectable recovery AP** — keep the setup access point permanently on,
  or automatically turn it off after the uplink connects and bring it back
  whenever the uplink drops.
- **Wake-on-LAN address book** — save up to 12 devices and send their UDP
  magic packets from the web UI, MQTT, or Home Assistant.
- **MQTT + Home Assistant** — retained health/network/Tailscale state,
  inbound AP/routing/Tailscale/reconnect/restart/WOL commands, Last Will
  availability, and automatic Home Assistant discovery (including one Wake
  button per saved device).
- **Robust by design** — encrypted config backup/restore, local-only manual
  OTA upload, per-sink (console + SD) log levels, auto AP-channel realign on
  STA roam, and pre-crash log capture.
- **Private by design** — no usage reports, crash uploads, release polling,
  or automatic firmware downloads. Outbound application traffic is limited
  to Tailscale and the MQTT broker explicitly configured by the operator.

## Hardware

| | |
|---|---|
| **Target** | ESP32-S3 with PSRAM (8 MB octal, 80 MHz) |
| **Reference board** | ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 **N16R8** (16 MB flash / 8 MB PSRAM) |
| **Radio** | Single 2.4 GHz — STA and AP share one radio (see [limitations](#known-limitations)) |
| **Storage (optional)** | microSD for the log flight-recorder |
| **Power** | USB-C; ~real-world draw of a small dev board |

**Only the ESP32-S3 is supported.** It's the board this firmware is
written for and tested on, and it's the only one I have. The PlatformIO
config still lists a few other targets (`esp32`, `esp32-c3`,
`wt32-eth01`) left over from earlier scaffolding, but I don't build or
test against them and have no idea whether they work — so I can't support
them. This is a free hobby project and I'm not planning to buy extra
boards just to validate other hardware. If you get it running elsewhere,
great — but you're on your own there, and PRs are welcome.

### Board compatibility notes (community-tested)

Real-world results from the field (see [#9](../../issues/9) and
[#10](../../pull/10) — thanks @bobcroft and @markvovo):

| Board | Result |
|---|---|
| **ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 N16R8** (genuine) | ✅ Reference — developed and tested on this |
| **Freenove ESP32-S3-WROOM N8R8** | ✅ Community-confirmed: AP, web UI, full setup |
| **Seeed XIAO ESP32-S3 N8R8** | ✅ Community-confirmed: AP join, plus the WireGuard/DERP data plane (both a direct peer-to-peer session and a relayed one). Web UI wasn't separately re-verified. See the first-flash note below |
| **YD-ESP32-S3 ("YD32") clones** | ❌ SoftAP never visible on air — fails even with a minimal ESP-IDF AP example, i.e. a board-level RF problem, not this firmware |

> **First flash on a XIAO:** one tester's board wouldn't accept the default AP
> password until they ran a full `esptool erase_flash` followed by a
> `factory_reset --confirm`, allowing a little extra time before retrying the
> join. No log survives from the failed first boot, so this is a known rough
> edge rather than a diagnosed bug. If you hit it, erase the flash and retry.
> The `factory-full.bin` asset on the
> [latest release](../../releases/latest) is a full-flash
> image and rewrites the NVS region too, so it sidesteps this as well.

## Quick start

### 1. Build & flash

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Csontikka/esp32-tailscale-subnet-router
cd esp32-tailscale-subnet-router

# PlatformIO (recommended)
pio run -e esp32-s3 -t upload

# …or ESP-IDF (>= 5.5.3)
idf.py set-target esp32s3
idf.py build flash monitor
```

> The web assets are embedded into the firmware at build time from
> `main/index.html`, so a single flash carries the whole UI.

### 2. First-time setup

On first boot the device brings up its own access point:

- SSID: **`ESP32-TSR-Setup`** (builds before v0.1.18: `myssid`),
  password: **`mypassword`**
- Connect to it and open **http://192.168.4.1** — set an admin password
  there, then rename the AP to your liking.

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/images/login.png" alt="First-run admin password" width="46%">
</div>

### 3. Join your WiFi

On **Network → Access Point / Uplink networks**, point the device at your
existing 2.4 GHz network and (optionally) rename the AP it broadcasts.

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/images/network-ap_v2.png" alt="Access Point configuration" width="80%">
</div>

### 4. Enrol on your tailnet

This is the one step with a couple of non-obvious Tailscale details — do
them once and the device stays on your tailnet for good.

#### 4a · Create a Tailscale auth key

Log in to the [Tailscale admin console](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys)
→ **Settings → Keys** and click **Generate auth key…**.

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/images/tailscale-keys-page.png" alt="Tailscale admin — Keys page" width="80%">
</div>

Fill in the dialog:

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/images/tailscale-auth-key-create.png" alt="Generate auth key dialog" width="70%">
</div>

| Option | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Description** | `esp32-router` | so you can find it later |
| **Reusable** | ✅ On | re-flash without regenerating a key |
| **Ephemeral** | ❌ **Off** | ephemeral nodes get garbage-collected when offline — bad for a device that reboots |
| **Pre-approved** | ✅ On *(if your tailnet uses device approval)* | lets the device join without a manual click |
| **Tags** | `tag:esp32` *(optional)* | handy for ACL targeting |
| **Expiration** | 90 days *(max)* | Tailscale caps this — you make the node **permanent** in 4c below |

Copy the key (it starts with `tskey-auth-…`).

#### 4b · Paste it into the device

On the device's **Tailscale** tab, paste the auth key, set a **hostname**,
and list the **subnet(s) to advertise** (your AP subnet is offered
automatically). Pick an **exit node** here too if you want AP clients to
egress through it. Save — the device registers with your tailnet on its
next connect.

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/images/tailscale_v2.png" alt="Tailscale configuration and peers" width="88%">
</div>

> **Approve the route.** A newly advertised subnet shows up in the Tailscale
> admin (Machines → your device → **Edit route settings**) and must be
> **approved** before peers can use it. And if you later change the AP subnet,
> re-approve the new route there — the old approval stays but no longer matches,
> so the subnet silently becomes unreachable until you do.

> **Reaching the *uplink* LAN (not just the AP subnet).** To expose the network
> the device is connected to (its STA/uplink side), advertise that subnet too and
> turn on **Source-NAT advertised routes**. That masquerades tunnel→LAN traffic to
> the device's own uplink IP (Tailscale's `--snat-subnet-routes` default), so
> upstream hosts can reply without a route back to the tailnet. Without it, the
> upstream router would need a static route (`100.64.0.0/10 → this device`).

> **🔑 Auth key vs. node key — read this once**
>
> - The **auth key** (`tskey-auth-…`) is a *one-time ticket*: the device uses
>   it only on first registration. After that it has its own private **node
>   key** (stored in NVS) and no longer needs the auth key — so it's fine if
>   the auth key later expires.
> - The **node key** is the device's long-term identity, and Tailscale expires
>   it after ~180 days by default. When it expires the device drops off the
>   tailnet — exactly what you *don't* want on an unattended sensor.
>
> So once the device shows up in your tailnet, **disable its node-key expiry**
> (next step). Skip it and everything looks fine for months, then the device
> silently falls off and you won't know why. Do it for every device you flash.

#### 4c · Disable node-key expiry (do this — always)

1. Open the [Tailscale **Machines** page](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines).
2. Find the new `esp32-router` entry.
3. Click the `⋯` menu → **Disable key expiry**.

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/images/tailscale-disable-key-expiry.png" alt="Tailscale admin — Disable key expiry" width="80%">
</div>

4. **Reboot the device** (Reboot on the **System** tab, or power-cycle). The
   expiry status is only re-fetched on a fresh control-plane login, so a plain
   reconnect isn't enough.

That's it — remote tailnet peers can now reach the IoT devices on the AP
subnet, and those devices can use the tailnet (and any exit node you picked).

## Web UI tour

The single-page UI has seven sections:

| Section | What's there |
|---|---|
| **Status** | Uplink, AP, Tailscale node + peer list, memory, uptime |
| **Network** | Uplink networks, AP (SSID/IP/DNS), DHCP reservations & leases, MAC denylist, port forwarding |
| **Tailscale** | Auth key, hostname, advertised routes, exit node, MTU, peer table |
| **Firewall** | The four ACL chains, rule editor, hit counters |
| **Diagnostics** | Route-explain, ping, traceroute, WiFi scan, live + SD logs |
| **Automation** | Wake-on-LAN address book, MQTT status/commands, broker watchdog, Home Assistant discovery |
| **System** | Device name, web password gate + idle timeout, manual firmware upload, SD-card logging, backup, danger zone, privacy status |

### Firewall / ACL

Four chains, evaluated first-match-wins; an empty chain allows by
default. Rules match on protocol, source/destination CIDR, ports, and
action, with live hit counters.

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/images/firewall_v2.png" alt="Firewall — four ACL chains with example rules" width="88%">
</div>

| Chain | Direction |
|---|---|
| `TO_ESP` | Internet → ESP |
| `FROM_ESP` | ESP → Internet |
| `TO_AP` | Clients → ESP |
| `FROM_AP` | ESP → Clients |

### Diagnostics

Route-explain answers "where would a packet to *X* actually go —
uplink, WireGuard, or DERP?", which is the fastest way to reason about
exit-node and subnet routing.

- **Data plane vs control plane.** WireGuard moves packets; Tailscale's
  DISCO/`ts2021` control plane decides *how* (direct UDP vs DERP relay).
  The firmware watches the WireGuard data plane and re-handshakes over
  DERP when a direct path dies, so an exit-node session survives a
  direct↔DERP transition without dropping.
- **Exit-node routing.** A route hook forces AP-client public traffic
  into the WireGuard tunnel when an exit node is set; CGNAT (`100.64/10`)
  always goes to the tunnel. If the exit node is down, traffic stops —
  it is **not** silently rerouted to the local uplink.
- **microlink.** The Tailscale-compatible stack lives in its own repo,
  [Csontikka/microlink](https://github.com/Csontikka/microlink) — itself
  based on the original [CamM2325/microlink](https://github.com/CamM2325/microlink) —
  attached here as a git submodule and pinned to the integration commit.
  Its `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/TAILSCALE_REFERENCE.md` go deeper.

See [`docs/CONFIGURATION.md`](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) for a field-by-field
configuration reference.

## Tailscale & Headscale

The device authenticates with a standard **Tailscale** auth key and has
been validated against the hosted Tailscale control plane.

**Headscale is supported** (validated against Headscale v0.28.0; requires
Headscale ≥ 0.26): set **Login server** to your server and authenticate
with a Headscale pre-auth key. Accepted forms:

- `host` or `host:port` — plain TCP, port defaults to 80
- `http://host[:port]` — e.g. `http://192.168.1.42:8080`
- `https://host[:port]` — TLS, port defaults to 443. The certificate is
  validated against the ESP-IDF public-CA bundle (Let's Encrypt works);
  **self-signed / private-CA certificates are not supported**.

The device fetches the server's Noise public key from `/key?v=88` and
reads the initial netmap from the streaming long-poll, matching what
current Headscale versions require.

`tailnet lock` is not supported (the device cannot sign its own node
key); disable it for the tailnet or pre-authorize the node.

## Known limitations

- **Single radio.** STA and AP share one 2.4 GHz radio and channel. If
  the upstream AP is on a different channel after a roam, throughput
  collapses until the device realigns (it auto-reboots to do so).
- **Throughput.** This is an MCU doing userspace crypto + NAT; expect
  roughly **0.3–1.4 Mbit/s** through the tunnel (plain STA highest, direct
  exit node mid, DERP-relayed exit node lowest), not gigabit. Plenty for
  IoT and remote-admin traffic.
- **Exit node fails closed.** By design — when a selected exit node is
  unreachable, AP-client internet traffic stops rather than leaking to
  the local uplink. Clear the exit node to restore direct internet.
- **Tailnet lock unsupported.** Headscale over HTTPS needs a public-CA
  certificate (self-signed is rejected).
- **2.4 GHz only**, single AP subnet.

## Privacy and outbound traffic

This build contains no usage reporting, crash upload, release polling, or
automatic firmware download. Crash summaries and logs stay on the device.
The only application-level outbound connections are Tailscale/Headscale and,
when enabled by the operator, the configured MQTT broker. DNS, DHCP and NTP
remain available as infrastructure needed to resolve and establish those
connections. Diagnostic ping and traceroute run only when explicitly started.

For the complete, explicit comparison with upstream `main`, see
[`CUSTOM_BRANCH.md`](CUSTOM_BRANCH.md). A ready-to-use Windows flash package is
documented in [`flash-package/README.txt`](flash-package/README.txt).

## Security

Please report vulnerabilities privately — see [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).
The repo runs CodeQL, Dependabot, secret scanning, and a custom
[Sensitive Data Check](.github/workflows/sensitive-check.yml) on every
push.
