# Configuration reference

Every setting below is configured from the device web UI. Changes are
written to NVS; some require a reboot to take effect (the UI flags a
pending reboot when so).

> IP addresses, SSIDs and peer names shown in screenshots throughout the
> docs are generic placeholders.

## Network → Device-wide network

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Hostname** | Name advertised on the uplink network (DHCP/mDNS). |
| **DNS mapping TTL override** | `0` = off. Overrides the TTL the device applies to DNS-learned routes, for roaming continuity. |

## Network → Uplink networks (STA)

Up to **5** networks, tried in order. Per network:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **SSID** | Upstream 2.4 GHz network to join. |
| **Password** | WPA2/WPA3 PSK. Leave empty to keep the stored one. |
| **Static IP** *(optional)* | `ip` / `mask` / `gw` / `dns`; empty = DHCP. |
| **WPA2-Enterprise (EAP)** *(optional)* | Method, phase-2, identity/username/password, optional CA bundle. |

## Network → Access Point (AP)

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **AP SSID** | — | Network this device broadcasts. |
| **AP password** | — | WPA2 PSK; leave empty to keep current. |
| **Channel** | *auto* | Read-only. The single 2.4 GHz radio is shared with the STA, so the AP automatically follows (and realigns to) the uplink channel — it is not operator-settable. |
| **AP IP / Subnet mask** | `192.168.4.1` / `255.255.255.0` | The AP subnet. Changing it offers to update the advertised Tailscale route. |
| **DNS served to AP clients** | this device | Empty = the on-board forwarder; or push a specific resolver. |
| **On-board DNS forwarder** | on | Resolver + PSRAM response cache for AP clients. |
| **Forwarder upstream** | learned / `1.1.1.1` | Upstream resolver the forwarder queries. |
| **Hide SSID** | off | Stop broadcasting the SSID in beacons. |

## Network → DHCP, clients, denylist, port forwarding

- **DHCP reservations** — pin an IP to a MAC (max 16).
- **Connected clients / Active leases** — live tables with per-client signal.
- **Denied MAC addresses** — block specific clients from associating.
- **Port forwarding** — map an external port to an AP-side client.

## Tailscale

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Enabled** | Master switch for the tailnet client. |
| **Auth key** | Tailscale auth key (`tskey-…`). Leave empty to keep current. |
| **Hostname** | Node name on the tailnet. |
| **Login server** | Custom control plane (Headscale). Empty = hosted Tailscale. Accepts `host`, `host:port`, `http://host[:port]`, `https://host[:port]` (TLS validates against public CAs only — no self-signed). Requires Headscale ≥ 0.26 (validated on v0.28.0). |
| **Advertised subnet routes** | One CIDR per line; the AP subnet is offered automatically. |
| **Source-NAT advertised routes** | Off by default. Masquerades traffic forwarded from the tunnel out to the uplink LAN (or out to the internet when this device is an exit node) to the device's own STA IP — the Tailscale default for subnet routers. **On** = the uplink subnet works the moment you advertise it (upstream hosts reply to this device, which un-NATs back into the tunnel). **Off** = the upstream router needs a static route for the tailnet (`100.64.0.0/10 → this device`) instead. Enabling it offers to add your uplink subnet to the advertised routes. ⚠️ Do **not** advertise *and* accept the same subnet — that loops the inbound route back into the tunnel. |
| **Exit node** | Route AP-client public traffic through this tailnet exit node. Fails closed if unreachable. |
| **Max peers** | Upper bound on tracked peers. |
| **Accept peer subnet routes** | Install routes other nodes advertise. |
| **LAN bypass when using an exit node** | RFC1918 destinations stay on the local LAN even with an exit node selected. |

### Tunnel MTU

`Auto (peer-aware)` is recommended — it derives the effective MTU/MSS
from the active path (direct vs DERP, exit vs not). A fixed MTU can be
forced (576–1500) if a path misbehaves.

## Firewall

Four chains, **first match wins**; an empty chain allows by default.

| Chain | Direction |
|---|---|
| `TO_ESP` | Internet → ESP |
| `FROM_ESP` | ESP → Internet |
| `TO_AP` | Clients → ESP |
| `FROM_AP` | ESP → Clients |

Per rule: **source** / **destination** (`any` or CIDR), **protocol**
(Any / ICMP / TCP / UDP), **source/dest port** (`0` = any, TCP/UDP only),
**action** (Allow / Deny).

## System

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Device name** | Friendly name shown in the UI header and `/api`. |
| **Timezone** | Device TZ; a real change flags a pending reboot. |
| **Outbound telemetry** | Not compiled in. Logs and crash summaries remain local; MQTT publishes only when explicitly configured and enabled. |
| **SD card logging** | Enable + per-sink (console / SD) log level; the on-device flight recorder. |
| **Firmware update (OTA)** | Manual upload, or polled auto-install window. Optional **beta channel** also offers GitHub pre-releases (off by default = stable releases only). |
| **Encrypted backup / restore** | Export/import the full config, encrypted with a passphrase. |
| **Danger zone** | Reboot, factory reset, reset Tailscale identity. |
