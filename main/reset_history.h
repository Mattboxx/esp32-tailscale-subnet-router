/* Reset-history ring buffer — keeps the 10 most recent boots persisted to
 * NVS as a single blob (`rst_hist`) so the System tab can show a full
 * trail back from "panic two boots ago" without needing serial logs.
 * Entry [0] is always the most recent boot.
 *
 * The recorder runs once at app_main() time, right after nvs_flash_init
 * and before the rest of the subsystems come up. It:
 *   - computes the boot reason (with FLASH / ROLLBACK detection via the
 *     app SHA8 fingerprint trick, since IDF v5.3 reports UNKNOWN both
 *     for first-boot and for the esptool/PIO post-flash chip reset),
 *   - reads any prior `rst_hist` blob (with v1→v2 migration),
 *   - shifts everything down a slot,
 *   - writes the current boot into hist[0],
 *   - persists the blob.
 *
 * The matching coredump backfill — when a core dump exists from the
 * panic that triggered this boot — writes a one-line crash summary into
 * hist[0].crash via reset_history_set_current_crash(). */

 * day; the partition is now 64K, so a 10-entry blob of 1800 B is comfortable.

 * culprit. The full panic dump still lives in the coredump partition; the
 * full frame list is kept locally in NVS for the Diagnostics page.
 * Note: a struct-size change invalidates the old blob, so reset history is
 * zeroed once on the first boot of this firmware (one-time, harmless). */
